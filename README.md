[Netsmart's Avatar™](https://www.ntst.com/Solutions-and-Services/Offerings/myAvatar) is a behavioral health EHR that offers a recovery-focused suite of solutions that leverage real-time analytics and clinical decision support to drive value-based care.

While Avatar™ is a robust platform, it isn't perfect. The good news is that you can extend myAvatar™ functionality via Netsmart's Avatar™ Web Services, and/or custom web services that are written by other Avatar™ users.

**Tingen** is one such custom web service which includes various tools and utilities for Avatar™ that aren't included in the official release, and provides a solid foundation for building additional functionality quickly and efficiently.

## Tingen features

* Several built-in tools and utilities that extend the functionality of Avatar™
* A solid foundation to build additional Avatar™ custom tools and utilities
* Extremely customizable
* Robust logging
* ...and [more](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen-Documentation/blob/main/Static/TingenFeatures.md)!

# Repository branches

There are three two types of branches in this repository:

* **[main](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen/tree/main)**  
  This is the latest stable release of Tingen. You can think of this as the Release Candidate for the Tingen [Community Release](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen-CommunityRelease).

* **Tingen archive snapshots**  
  When development starts on a new monthly version, the previous version is archived to a separate branch (e.g., `24.9.0-stable`).

# Roadmaps and Changelogs

You can also review the Tingen [Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/spectrum-health-systems/projects/51/views/3) and [Changelog](https://github.com/orgs/spectrum-health-systems/projects/51/views/4?groupedBy%5BcolumnId%5D=141162315&filterQuery=status%3ACompleted).

Remember, though, that the majority of the upcoming features/changes will be part of [Outpost31](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Outpost31).

## Other projects

The reason why this repository is pretty bare-bones is because all of the development work is really done in 

* [**Tingen_development**](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen_development)  
  The development version of Tingen

* [**Outpost31**](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Outpost31)  
  The core components/logic of Tingen
