[Netsmart's Avatar™](https://www.ntst.com/Solutions-and-Services/Offerings/myAvatar) is a behavioral health EHR that offers a recovery-focused suite of solutions that leverage real-time analytics and clinical decision support to drive value-based care.

While Avatar™ is a robust platform, it isn't perfect. The good news is that you can extend myAvatar™ functionality via Netsmart's Avatar™ Web Services, and/or custom web services that are written by other Avatar™ users.

The **Tingen Web Service** is one such custom web service which includes various tools and utilities for Avatar™ that aren't included in the official release, and provides a solid foundation for building additional functionality quickly and efficiently.

For more infomation about the Tingen Web Service, please visit the [repository](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/ScriptLink-and-Web-Services") and/or read the [documentation](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen-Documentation).

### Outpost31

The Tingen Web Service requires [**Outpost31**](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Outpost31), which contains the core components/logic for the Tingen Web Service.
