# About Tingen

This repository is used for the latest **stable** Tingen release

Most likely this repository isn't going to be much use to you because it's ***not intended to be used in production environments***.

This repository is public because I want everything Tingen-related to be transparent and reviewable.

Also, unlike the [development versions](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen-Development) of Tingen, the stable release should be pretty clean and pretty.

If you're looking for something to use in your production environment, please see the the Community Release of Tingen (coming soon). <!--[the Community Release](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen-CommunityRelease).-->

And as always, please read the [Tingen documentation](https://github.com/spectrum-health-systems/Tingen-Documentation).
